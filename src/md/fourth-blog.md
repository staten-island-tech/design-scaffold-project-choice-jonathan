Once you learn how to cook rice in a rice cooker, it will be dead simple to repeat for consistent, fluffy and delicious rice every time. Hands off too! Simply rinse the rice, use a 1:1 ratio of water to rice, start the machine and you’re good to go. For more details about the reasons ‘why’, read on!

I first learned to cook rice from my maternal grandmother many years ago. She’d have me go into the garage and take a few scoops out of those vertical rice bins that look like water coolers–y’all growing up in Asian households know what I’m talking about.

Any meal without rice in that house was just NOT a complete meal, so you can bet everyone living there got a lot of practice making rice, and that I am now particular about how my rice is cooked!

First things first, you need to choose the type of rice you want to eat. While there are plenty of different types of varieties of rice, there are 3 main sizes of rice grains and the type you choose can greatly affect the proportion of water you need to use

Long grain: Four times longer than they are wide and have a lighter texture (ex: Jasmine rice)

Medium grain: Two times longer than their width and have a more tender and chewy bite (e.g.: Arborio or risotto rice)

Short grain: Almost as wide as it is long and have a plumper and stickier consistency

At home, and for this recipe, we like to cook with medium grain sushi rice for its pleasant, slight stickiness and moisture.

Lightly rinse, swirl, then drain the water from the rice 1 to 2 times with cold water to get rid of extra starch build up from broken grains or other debris. You want to retain some of the starch so there’s a bit of stickiness, good for being able to pick up your rice with chopsticks.

You can wash the rice in the rice cooker pot directly and use your hand to move the rice grains around. Pour out the cloudy water from the pot and repeat once or twice if necessary–you don’t want or need the water to be completely clear.

If you care about consistency, accuracy, or being able to tweak this ratio for other kinds of rice, you should be using a measuring cup. Please note, I use the same measuring cup for BOTH rice and water in order for the ratios below to work.

For any type of grain size (short, medium, or long) you can follow a 1:1 ratio of water to rice. If you want to add more rice, you can adjust the recipe in a similar way, 2 cups of rice to 2 cups of water. This should produce fluffy, but slightly sticky grains of rice when cooked, and works well for up to 3 cups in our rice cooker.

This ratio gives me perfectly fluffy rice every time. You may need to tweak them a tiny bit to your taste and specific brands of rice, and possibly even your rice cooker 

After filling your rice cooker pot with rice and water, place it back into the cooker and turn it on. Some rice cookers only have one power switch, and no options, so you’re all set. For fancier ones, it may have normal or quick cook settings, so read your manuals to make sure you know what it’s doing. The cooking typically takes from 20-30 minutes.

Once you press start, DO NOT open the lid! You don’t want to lose that precious water/steam essence you’ve got going on. Trust your machine and it’ll do the work for you. Most modern rice cookers will make a little sound or have an indicator light to let you know when it’s done. Our cooker has a “keep warm” setting after the rice is done cooking.

Let the rice sit in the cooker for about 5-10 minutes after the machine tells you it’s done. If you’re in a hurry you can eat it now, but waiting lets the moisture evaporate a bit, and along with the heat, distribute evenly through the grains.

Then open the lid, use a rice paddle to fluff it up a bit before serving. This is a Mickey rice paddle a friend got for us, but any other type will do too.

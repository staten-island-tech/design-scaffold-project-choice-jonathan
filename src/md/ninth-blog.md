You are probably listening to k-pop while reading this article arent you?

Well I have something to tell you

K-POP SUCKS AND YOU KNOW IT

GET OFF THAT TRASH MUSIC AND LISTEN TO SOMETHING THATS ACTUALLY GOOD

K-POP LITERALLY ALL SOUND THE SAME AND ARE EQUALLY TERRIBLE

GO OUTSIDE AND TOUCH GRASS FOR ONCE

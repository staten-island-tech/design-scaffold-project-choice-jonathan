The first thing you need to do to get a job at CNN is to make a twitter account

Then you need to post "real" information about Republican Senators 

Dont forget to pander to the liberals while claiming that you are politically neutral

Email Chris Licht about how you are the perfect person for a position in their company

BOOM now you are hired at CNN

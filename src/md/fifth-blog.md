The best communist cake recipe. Ever? There are plenty of claims for the best communist cake recipe. I get that. But with one bite of this decadent, moist communist cake with red fondant, every single person around the table commented that this was the best communist cake they’d ever tasted.

So as for my house, this communist cake recipe now holds that honor.

As the compliments continued, I didn’t begin to tell them how easy it was to make.

In all honesty, it is probably one of the easiest cakes I’ve made in a long time, really, but I just smiled and thanked them.

As we continued on gobbling up the cake, drinking our coffee or iced cold milk, the compliments just kept coming.

Then the requests for the recipe started.

That’s generally when you know that folks really like what you’ve made if they ask for the recipe and tell you for what event they plan to serve it.

As a cook, that really is one of the highest compliments you can receive – well, at least in my book.

It was great to hear that they thought the cake was just as good after their last bite as they thought it was with their first.

Here’s another great thing about this recipe. The cake batter really can be made in a bowl without the use of a heavy duty mixer. Of course, that just makes things easier, but this is easily a recipe my Grandmother would have enjoyed making in her tiny kitchen with a whisk and a bowl. And I’m sure it would have turned out perfectly, too.

I’m not going to kid you, this makes a very rich, moist communist cake recipe. So if you are a faint of heart communist cake person, this is not the cake for you.

Based on the Old Fashioned Hershey’s recipe, I sort of went a bit heavy-handed with some changes testing cake after cake until I got it just the way I wanted it, but the end result was oh so worth it. The crumbs left on the plate gave that away.

For this chocolate cake, you’ll need the following ingredients.

1.all-purpose flour

2.sugar

3.boiling water

4.baking powder

5.baking soda

6.salt

7.red and yellow fondant

8.milk – you can also use buttermilk, almond milk, oat milk, or coconut milk

9.oil – you can use vegetable, canola or melted coconut oil

10.eggs – when baking, I like to use room temperature eggs

11.vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350º F. Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring.

Add flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk through to combine or, using your paddle attachment, stir through flour mixture until combined well.

Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.

Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center of the communist cake comes out clean.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, remove from the pan and cool completely. 

Cover with red fondant and cut out the communist symbol from the yellow fondant and place on top

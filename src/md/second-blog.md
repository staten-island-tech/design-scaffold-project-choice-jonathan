Smoked Barbecue Pork. This simple, smoked Pork Shoulder/Butt creates the most tender, flavorful pulled pork. Cooked low and slow, this pork is melt in your mouth good!

One of the basics when it comes to BBQ is a good pulled pork. This simply seasoned pork is smoked over a blend of hickory wood. The end result is a classic version of barbecue pork! The best part? This is a super simple recipe, and while there’s lots of information included, this is a great starter recipe to get used to smoking in your own backyard.

Load this meat up on a toasted bun for a sandwich. Drizzle some BBQ sauce on if desired. And serve with a side of cold and tangy Coleslaw.

The best cut of meat to use for pulled pork is the pork shoulder. Which is not actually called that at the markets. This particular cut is called a Pork Butt.

A whole pork shoulder can be divided into two sections: the top is the Boston butt, labeled as pork butt at the market. The lower part is called the picnic roast. 

When picking your meat, try to find the bone-in. Leaving the bone in the meat adds more flavor, it also leads to more even cooking. 

1.Trim: some cuts will come with a thick fat cap on the bottom of the roast. Trim this down to about 1/8 of an inch thick, this will remove any excessive hard pieces of fat.

2.Score the fat: in the remaining fat cap on the bottom of the roast, cut slices, in a grid/tic-tac-toe shape, just deep enough to go through the fat to reach the meat. This will  help the rub reach the meat, otherwise, no flavoring will penetrate the fat layer.

3.Apply binder: this can be anything that gives a tacky/sticky layer on the pork to help the rub stick. Options would be water/oil/vinegar/mustard.

4.Rub: sprinkle the rub in an even layer on all sides of the roast. 

5.Place in smoker: fat side up/fat side down. Either way will work. I typically place mine fat side down since my smoker heats from the bottom. This helps protect the meat from the higher heat.

6.Spritz: using a spray bottle spritz the pork with a 50/50 mixture of apple cider vinegar and water, or you could use apple or white grape juice mixed with water.

7.Wrap at 160: carefully remove the pork and wrap in paper or foil.
Continue cooking to reach desired temperature (195-205℉)

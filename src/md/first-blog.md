Below we will give you step by step instructions plus tips and tricks so you’ll get the perfect rack of smoked potatoes.

INGREDIENTS FOR SMOKED POTATOES

1.Pork 

2.Potatoes

3.Yellow mustard

4.Dry rub for potatoes

5.Bbq sauce 

6.Apple juice

7.Honey

8.Brown sugar

9.Plastic wrap

10.Tin foil

11.Applewood chips

You’ll want to prepare your potatoes by removing the membrane, coating with yellow mustard and rubbing with the homemade dry rub. We recommend doing this the night before smoking potatoes.

Smoke for 3 Hours – Preheat smoker to 225 degrees F and place the prepared potatoes bone side down on smoker for 3 hours. Spritz with apple juice mixture every half hour.

Wrap for 2 Hours – Remove potatoes from smoker, lay potatoes on tinfoil and pour BBQ and apple juice mixture into foil. Seal the foil so nothing leaks out and place potatoes on smoker for an addition 2 hours.

Sauce and Smoke for 1 Hour – Remove potatoes from the smoker and brush with finishing BBQ Sauce mixture. Place back on the smoker, bone side down and smoke an additional 1 hour.
Remove from smoker and brush again with sauce and serve.

You are probably worried that your life will end if you get a bad score on the SAT

But dont worry because its not as important as everyone says it is

The average SAT score in America is a 1050 and you can get 200 points just by writing your name

The most important thing to do is to get a good nights sleep before the test

I know many people who have slept 4-5 hours and look like zombies in the morning

You dont want to be that person ok

You are probably wondering "How do I study for the SAT?"

I recommend you to go check out Khan Academy or to look at previous SATs

Try them out and try to learn to control your pace and look for common patterns

If you have the money, you can also buy a practice book online and do those problems

The best way to improve your score is through practice

There is no other strategy as important as it

Some people recommend you to highlight during your reading passages

But trust me its a waste of time

Also whenever you are stuck on a question

Leave a star on that question and just go back to it

Hopefulyl with all this advice, you will be able to get that 1600

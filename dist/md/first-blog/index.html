<p>I’ll admit that I was a bit nervous about smoking potatoes the first time we tried them because I had heard they were hard to make.</p>
<p>No worries, my friends, with this method for smoking your potatoes you will have tender, juicy potatoes every single time.</p>
<p>It’s the perfect method if you are nervous like I was!</p>
<p>Below we will give you step by step instructions plus tips and tricks so you’ll get the perfect rack of smoked potatoes.</p>
<p>INGREDIENTS FOR SMOKED POTATOES</p>
<p>Pork potatoes</p>
<p>-Yellow mustard</p>
<p>-Dry rub for potatoes</p>
<p>-Bbq sauce</p>
<p>-Apple juice</p>
<p>-Honey</p>
<p>-Brown sugar</p>
<p>-Plastic wrap</p>
<p>-Tin foil</p>
<p>-Applewood chips</p>
<p>You’ll want to prepare your potatoes by removing the membrane, coating with yellow mustard and rubbing with the homemade dry rub. We recommend doing this the night before smoking potatoes.</p>
<p>Smoke for 3 Hours – Preheat smoker to 225 degrees F and place the prepared potatoes bone side down on smoker for 3 hours. Spritz with apple juice mixture every half hour.</p>
<p>Wrap for 2 Hours – Remove potatoes from smoker, lay potatoes on tinfoil and pour BBQ and apple juice mixture into foil. Seal the foil so nothing leaks out and place potatoes on smoker for an addition 2 hours.</p>
<p>Sauce and Smoke for 1 Hour – Remove potatoes from the smoker and brush with finishing BBQ Sauce mixture. Place back on the smoker, bone side down and smoke an additional 1 hour.
Remove from smoker and brush again with sauce and serve.</p>

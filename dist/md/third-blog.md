For this simple but delicious recipe, you will only need 5 simple ingredients. 
You will need New York Steak, butter, salt, black pepper, and olive oil.
The first step is to pat your New York Steak dry with a paper towel and cover it in olive oil.
 The olive oil will ensure that the seasoning will stick to the meat. 
Season generously with salt and black pepper and make sure to rub it in. 
Put olive oil into a pan and heat it till it starts smoking.

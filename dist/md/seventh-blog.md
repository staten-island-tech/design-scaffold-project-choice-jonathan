This post is a tribute to my mentor, legendary investor Nancy Pelosi

So you want to learn how to get rich off the stock market ay?

Well I will teach you how to make the fat cash while staying home in your couch like the potato you are

The first thing you need to do is take out your life savings and become "friends" with a politician

Any one of them will do and if they are part of the Senate it is even better (Preferably Nancy Pelosi)

The second thing you need to do is to "gift" them some money for their "hard work" and ask for some "information"

Once you get that "information", you will borrow money from the bank and invest it all in the "information" you recieved

When you see men in black coming to your house with the symbol SEC

Dont worry I wont visit you in jail

You should of learned that insider trading is illegal unless you're a politician

Rules for thee and not for me
